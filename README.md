## Attack Vectors in Healthcare Devices - A Multi-Protocol Dataset for Assessing IoMT Device Security
The main goal of this research is to propose a realistic benchmark dataset to enable the development and evaluation of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) security solutions. To accomplish this, 18 attacks were executed against an IoMT testbed composed of 40 IoMT devices (25 real devices and 15 simulated devices), considering the plurality of protocols used in healthcare (e.g., Wi-Fi, MQTT and Bluetooth).

These attacks are categorized into five classes: DDoS, DoS, Recon, MQTT, and spoofing. This effort aims to establish a baseline complementary to the state-of-the-art contributions and supports researchers in investigating and developing new solutions to make healthcare systems more secure using different mechanisms (e.g., machine learning - ML).
